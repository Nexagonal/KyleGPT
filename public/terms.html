    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="date">Effective Date: February 26, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to <span class="highlight">KyleGPT</span>. By creating an account or using the app, you agree to these
        Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>KyleGPT is a satirical messaging application designed as a parody of modern AI chatbots. When you use the app,
        you are communicating directly with a human administrator ("Admin") who manually types responses in real-time.
        The service is provided on an "as-is" basis.</p>

    <h2>2. Account &amp; Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be at least <span class="highlight">13 years of age</span> to use KyleGPT.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials.</li>
        <li>One account per person. Accounts are non-transferable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree <span class="highlight">not</span> to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the service for any unlawful purpose or to transmit illegal content.</li>
        <li>Attempt to access another user's account or data.</li>
        <li>Interfere with, disrupt, or overload the service (e.g., spamming, denial-of-service).</li>
        <li>Reverse-engineer, decompile, or tamper with the application.</li>
        <li>Circumvent any security measures, including rate limits and authentication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Content &amp; Communications</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Messages you send are encrypted end-to-end. The server stores only encrypted data and cannot read your
            messages in transit or at rest.</li>
        <li>You retain ownership of the content you create.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">By using KyleGPT, you grant the Admin a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use
                the Admin's own responses and conversation patterns for the purpose of developing and improving AI
                models.</span> This license applies only to the Admin's own messages and does not extend to your
            messages unless you provide separate, explicit consent.</li>
        <li>The Admin may review conversations (via the Admin interface) to respond to your messages and to improve the
            service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. AI Training Disclosure</h2>
    <p>The Admin may use their own response history from conversations to train, fine-tune, or develop language models.
        This applies <span class="highlight">only to the Admin's own messages</span>. User messages will not be used for
        AI training without separate, explicit, opt-in consent. Any AI models developed from this data will not expose
        individual user identities or private information.</p>

    <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
    <p>Your use of KyleGPT is also governed by our <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which describes what data we
        collect and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>7. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>You may permanently delete your account at any time via the sidebar in the app or by contacting the Admin. Upon
        deletion, all your
        messages, chat history, device tokens, encryption keys, and Firebase authentication data will be permanently
        removed. This action cannot be undone.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms. You may stop using the
        service at any time.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>KyleGPT is provided <span class="highlight">"as is"</span> without warranties of any kind, express or
            implied.</li>
        <li>We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service.</li>
        <li>Responses from the Admin are personal opinions and should not be considered professional advice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer and Admin shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental,
        special, or consequential damages arising from your use of KyleGPT.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the
        revised Terms. Material changes will be communicated via the app.</p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about these Terms, contact: <a href="mailto:kylenamgostar@gmail.com">kylenamgostar@gmail.com</a>
